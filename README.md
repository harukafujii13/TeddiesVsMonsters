## ** ABOUT **

As part of a collaborative team project, we developed a gaming website for a real client. The site not only offers a platform where users can purchase gaming-related products but also serves as a hub for all essential company information.

### Features

- Developed a fully functional shopping cart allowing visitors to add and remove products, with a clear display of selected items and the total payable amount.
- Integrated Stripe for secure and reliable payment processing, enabling authenticated users to proceed smoothly to checkout.
- Leveraged Storybook to create a component library, promoting consistency and reusability across the application.
